Because generating shipping labels shouldn't require a bloated GUI, an NDA, or a prayer to the SaaS gods.  
This is a raw, scriptable label generator for DHL, FedEx, DPD, and more.  
Built with Next.js, but not for influencers — for automation.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Run the dev server like a civilized person:

```bash
npm run dev  # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, bun dev — pick your poison
````

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser (if you haven’t firewalled it off yet).
Edit `app/page.tsx` to update content — hot reload does its thing.
